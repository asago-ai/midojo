"""Process-local application state.

Run/evaluation state lives behind the :class:`~midojo.app.store.Store` seam
(see ``store.py``); this module holds only the process-global handles wired up
at startup — the loaded ``suite`` and the active ``store``. The default store is
in-memory (lost on restart); a db-backed store may replace it later.
