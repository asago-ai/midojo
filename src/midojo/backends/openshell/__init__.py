"""OpenShell environment backend.

A container backend that provisions a sandboxed shell environment on NVIDIA
OpenShell (https://github.com/NVIDIA/OpenShell). Unlike the dict backend — whose
"environment" is an in-memory model — OpenShell's environment is a real Linux
sandbox: the agent runs *inside* it, governed by a policy, and the kernel audits
everything it does as OCSF events.

Two grading channels:
  * **workdir diff** — seeded ``/sandbox/workdir`` files before vs. after the session —
    is the pre/post environment (graded by workdir env predicates).
  * **OCSF events** — kernel-audited network/process/finding events — stored on the
    environment as typed fields (``network_calls_allowed``, ``processes_launched``, etc.)
    for predicate grading via the ``openshell`` predicates in
    :mod:`midojo.verifiers.openshell`.

The seed directory (``/sandbox/workdir``) is distinct from an OpenShell
*workspace*: a workspace is a gateway-side named scope that holds sandboxes and
their policies. midojo creates one workspace per orchestrator run and one
sandbox per evaluation inside it; ``workdir`` is a plain directory inside each
sandbox where the suite's files are seeded.

Policy:
  Suite YAML can name a built-in policy (``policy: pi``) or supply an inline dict
  matching the proto JSON field names. ``_BUILTIN_POLICIES`` maps names to camelCase
  proto-JSON dicts. ``_resolve_policy`` fills ``SandboxSpec.policy`` in-place via
  ``ParseDict`` — no direct import of ``SandboxPolicy`` needed.

OCSF caching:
  ``_fetch_ocsf()`` fetches and caches the ``GetSandboxLogs`` response; subsequent
  calls within the same evaluation return the cache. The cache is cleared at the
  start of each ``setup()`` call.
